# Definition of Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

# Characteristics of an Algorithm

1. An algorithm should have well defined inputs and outputs(e.g Two numbers 'a' and 'b' as inputs and the sum of 'a' and 'b' as outputs)

2. Each step in an algorithm should be clear and unambiguous

3. An algorithm should be language independent. It is a sequence of instructions that can be implemented in any language

# Why Algorithms?

1. As a developer, you're going to come across problems that you need to solve

2. Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems

3. One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms

4. Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance
