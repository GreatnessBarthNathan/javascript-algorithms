# Search Algorithms

We will be focusing on :

1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Recursive binary search

## The Approach

- We start off by mentioning the problem statement
- We try solving the problem on our own
- We will then implement the solution together
- We will determine the Big-O time complexity of the solution
