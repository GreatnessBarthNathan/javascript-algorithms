## Math Algorithms

We will be looking at problems relating to

1. Fibonacci sequence
2. Factorial of a number
3. Prime number
4. Power of two
5. Recursion
6. Fibonacci sequence with recursion
7. Factorial of a number with recursion

# The Approach

- We will start with the problem statement - i.e what is asked from us
- We are required to pause the video and try solving the problem
- Then we will implement the solution together
- Determine the Big-O time complexity of the solution
