# Sorthing Algorithms

The sorting algorithms we will be learning are:

- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort

## The Approach

We will mention the problem statement

Pause the video and try to solve the problem

Implement the solution together

Determing the Big-O time complexity of our solution
